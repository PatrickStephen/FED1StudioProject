            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We found a passion in BBQ that we hope to share with the world! We take pride in the quality of food we provide for the public and thought "What a better way to make people happy than to show them how to provide this quality of food for them selfs?" That is when we started Stephen's Q'. We hope you enjoy your time learning with us but most importantly, enjoy the food you create!

                <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
            <p>
                This school is about spreading happiness rather than making a profit. We started as a home cook who just enjoyed cooking for others. When we created a resturant we stuck to the same moto. That moto lead to us to creating a school so others with our passion can do the same with their friends and family.
            </p>

            <h2>Class Subjects</h2>
            <p>

Finally, we will empliment all of these tecniques into making your own main entres!
